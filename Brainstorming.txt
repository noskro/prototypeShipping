Unlock Meta Quests:
- Travel X Tiles
- Travel X Tiles from center
- Reach world's end/border
- Discover X Islands
- Trade with X Cities / TRade for X Gold
- Destroy X Pirate Ships
- Kill X sea monsters
- Survive x storms


Things to do in Run:
- Discover Islands
- Fight pirates / sea monsters
- cities:
	- Trade with cities
	- Accept missions for cites (city difficulty levels? Mabye based on distance to Spawn? That way further away cities have no doable quests at the start of the round)
	- Improve relation with cities (better relation = more gold / more things to do)
	- Improve ship (Maybe min relation is required for upgrades, and max upgrade depends on city difficulty? The further the progress the better upgrades you can aquire)


City missions:
- Defeat nearby pirate(s) (maybe spawn extra pirates for that? maybe with quest marker?)
- Defeat nearby sea monster(s) (same as pirates)
- Defeat nearby priate nest/city/island (is it already spawned or does the island only spawn after accepting the quest?)
- Trade with island X hexes away?
- Explore X hexes around the cities-island (maybe half/all/70% of hexes in a 10/20/x hex radius)
- Protect ship on route? (a trade ship is going to the city or from city somewhere else and you need to follow it and protect from pirates/monsters/whatever?)
- Find and rescue sunken ship/survivors somewhere? (Hint could be "North", or "around 30 hexes away", ...)
- Discover island of specific Biome?
- Create new city/colony somewhere??



Ship improvements:
- Hull (lives)
- Storage (trade amount = gold=
- Sails (speed - how to implement that in game?)
- Outlook (viewing range)
- Canons 
	- at some point (higher level cities or after unlocking), tier 2 canons with 2 hexes range. maybe even more tiers later
? (Something for crew spaces? How many officers can be drafted? Or is that purely based on ship type?)

- All upgrades:
	- should have a maximum based on thecurrent ship type
	


Other Ideas:
- Different Biomes for islands??
	- Gras / Forest
	- Jungle
	- Desert
	- Ice
	- Mountain
	- Maybe different biomes have different bonuses for cities / different quests / whatever
? How to unlock new officers
	? From some city quests
	? From some meta upgrade achievements
	? From a random pirate ship (e.g. defeated pirates first mate)
	? from a random discovery (e.g. Shiffsbr√ºchiger)
- Probably better with no starting "home port/island"
? Should there be real trade (pickup/deliver/different prices/values) or is the current "Trade button = get x gold" good/simple enough for now?
	+ Detailed Trade brings more options/things to do/variety (city quests, achievements, rewards, ...)
	- Detailed trade with comparing prices are just a pain in the ass and I hate it
	- Detailed trade is a lot more work (data model, sprites, interfaces, ...)
