  Texts:
  - You docked your ship in the harbor of a city. Here you have the choice on how
    to improve your coming voyage. All citys offer trade which will bring coin into
    your pocket. Upgraded cities can also repair your ship, offer crewman to recruite
    or you can visit the tavern to listen into the latest stories. Choose wisely
    as every city will only allow you one action.
