  Texts:
  - Don't worry when your ship sinks. It happens to the best. Good thing the Empire
    has the best open seas rescue agency. They will pick up you and your valuables
    and bring you back home. It would be a good idea to spend some of your profits
    on upgrades for your ship. That way you will last longer in the future.
