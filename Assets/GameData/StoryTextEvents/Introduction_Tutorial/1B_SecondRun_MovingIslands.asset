  Title: Moving Islands
  Texts:
  - You've never been that far out before during you training. So don't be alarmed
    that the world changed. Everything is eternally flowing in the currents of the
    world. Even the islands. So it is no wonder the world looks different every time
    you set sail into it. You just have to get used to it.
