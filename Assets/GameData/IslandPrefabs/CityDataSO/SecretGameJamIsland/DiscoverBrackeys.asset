  - What are you gamers doing? I told you there is nothing more to discover. Not
    even this easter egg! I guess I should have known that you can't stop playing. 
    If you like the game or have any ideas how to improve it, please let us know.
    You probably already are on our itch page </advertisement> This is now truly
    the end. I promise ;)
